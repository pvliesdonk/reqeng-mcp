# Test .deb installation in a Debian/Ubuntu container.
#
# Usage:
#   # Build the .deb first:
#   VERSION=0.0.0-test nfpm package --packager deb --target dist/
#
#   # Then run this script inside a Debian 12+ / Ubuntu 22.04+ container:
#   docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/work" -w /work debian:bookworm bash packaging/test-install.sh
#
# The script verifies:
#   1. Package installs without errors
#   2. System user/group created
#   3. Directories exist with correct ownership
#   4. systemd unit file is parseable (systemd-analyze verify)
#   5. Environment example file installed
#   6. Package removes cleanly
