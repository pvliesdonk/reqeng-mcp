## Features

<!-- DOMAIN-START -->
<!-- Replace with 3-7 bullets describing what this MCP server does. Kept across copier update. -->

- **[Capability 1]** — one-sentence description of a user-visible feature.
- **[Capability 2]** — one-sentence description of another capability.
- **MCP tools** — N LLM-visible tools exposed; see `src/reqeng_mcp/tools.py`.
- **MCP resources** — M resources exposing domain state; see `src/reqeng_mcp/resources.py`.
- **MCP prompts** — K prompt templates; see `src/reqeng_mcp/prompts.py`.
<!-- DOMAIN-END -->

## What you can do with it

<!-- DOMAIN-START -->
<!-- Replace with 3-5 concrete "you can ask Claude to X" examples. Kept across copier update. -->

With this server mounted in an MCP client (Claude, etc.), you can:

- **[Task 1]** — "[example user request]." Composes tools `[tool_a]` + `[tool_b]`.
- **[Task 2]** — "[another example request]." Uses resource `[resource_x]`.
- **[Task 3]** — "[third example]."

Short, concrete prompts beat abstract feature lists — replace the
`[Task N]` placeholders with prompts that actually work against your
server's tool surface.

## Installation

### From PyPI

```bash
pip install pvliesdonk-reqeng-mcp
```

If you add optional extras via the `PROJECT-EXTRAS-START` / `PROJECT-EXTRAS-END` sentinels in `pyproject.toml`, document them below:

<!-- DOMAIN-START -->
<!-- List optional extras and their purpose here (e.g. `pip install pvliesdonk-reqeng-mcp[embeddings]`). Kept across copier update. -->
<!-- DOMAIN-END -->

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pvliesdonk/reqeng-mcp.git
cd reqeng-mcp
uv sync --all-extras --all-groups
```

### Docker

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/pvliesdonk/reqeng-mcp:latest
```

A `compose.yml` ships at the repo root as a starting point — copy `.env.example` to `.env`, edit, and `docker compose up -d`.

To attach a remote Python debugger (development only — the protocol is unauthenticated), see [Remote debugging](docs/deployment/docker.md#remote-debugging).

### Linux packages (.deb / .rpm)

Download `.deb` or `.rpm` packages from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/pvliesdonk/reqeng-mcp/releases) page. Both install a hardened systemd unit; env configuration is sourced from `/etc/reqeng-mcp/env` (copy from the shipped `/etc/reqeng-mcp/env.example`).

### Claude Desktop (.mcpb bundle)

Download the `.mcpb` bundle from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/pvliesdonk/reqeng-mcp/releases) page and double-click to install, or run:

```bash
mcpb install reqeng-mcp-<version>.mcpb
```

Claude Desktop prompts for required env vars via a GUI wizard — no manual JSON editing needed.

## Quick start

```bash
reqeng-mcp serve                                # stdio transport
reqeng-mcp serve --transport http --port 8000   # streamable HTTP
```

For library usage (embedding the domain logic without the MCP transport), import from the `reqeng_mcp` package directly — see the project's domain modules under `src/reqeng_mcp/` for entry points.

### Server info

The server registers a built-in `get_server_info` tool (via `fastmcp_pvl_core.register_server_info_tool`) so operators can confirm the deployed version with a single MCP call. The default response carries `server_name`, `server_version`, and `core_version`. Servers that talk to a remote upstream wire upstream version reporting inside the `DOMAIN-UPSTREAM-START` / `DOMAIN-UPSTREAM-END` sentinel in `src/reqeng_mcp/server.py` — see [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md#server-info-tool-get_server_info) for the wiring pattern.

### File exchange

The server scaffolds [MCP File Exchange](docs/guides/file-exchange.md)
wiring — download direction is registered by default (on for HTTP/SSE,
off for stdio); an upload direction ships fully commented-out for
opt-in via `register_file_exchange_upload(...)`. See the guide for
producing / consuming / uploading patterns and the env-var matrix, or
[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md#file-exchange-register_file_exchange--opt-in-upload)
for the wiring pattern.

## Configuration

Core environment variables shared across all `fastmcp-pvl-core`-based services:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Log level for FastMCP internals and app loggers (`DEBUG` / `INFO` / `WARNING` / `ERROR`). The `-v` CLI flag overrides to `DEBUG`. |
| `FASTMCP_ENABLE_RICH_LOGGING` | `true` | Set to `false` for plain / structured JSON log output. |
| `REQENG_MCP_EVENT_STORE_URL` | `memory://` | Event store backend for HTTP session persistence — `memory://` (dev), `file:///path` (survives restarts). |

Domain-specific variables go below under [Domain configuration](#domain-configuration).

## Authorization (opt-in)

This server inherits opt-in per-subject authorization from `fastmcp-pvl-core`.  The default posture is **off** — every authenticated caller can use every tool, resource, and prompt.  Turn it on by pointing `REQENG_MCP_ACL_PATH` at a TOML ACL file; the middleware is installed only when the path is set, and individual tools opt in by declaring `meta={"required_scope": "<scope>"}` at registration.  A tool without `required_scope` is unrestricted regardless of caller.

Wire it in by uncommenting the `acl_path` field in `src/reqeng_mcp/config.py` and the `AuthorizationMiddleware` stanza in `src/reqeng_mcp/server.py` — both ship as commented stubs in the scaffold.

### ACL TOML schema

```toml
[subjects]
"user:alice@example.com" = ["read", "write"]
"user:admin@example.com" = ["*"]              # wildcard — any required scope passes
"service:ci-bot"         = ["read"]
"local"                  = ["*"]              # stdio mode subject
```

- **Subject strings are opaque.** The `<kind>:<id>` convention is documentation only; the library treats each subject as a literal string.
- **`*` is the only library-treated special scope** — it grants every required scope.  Subject-side wildcards (`*` as an ACL key) are rejected at load time.
- **Scope vocabulary is domain-defined.** Per-project or per-folder gating is encoded into the scope string itself (e.g. `read:project-foo`, `write:vault/personal`); `fastmcp-pvl-core` treats every scope except `*` as opaque.

### Subject ↔ bearer-token alignment

The subject string used as a *value* in the bearer-tokens TOML (`REQENG_MCP_BEARER_TOKENS_FILE`) is the same string used as a *key* in the ACL TOML.  Same string, opposite roles — keep the two files consistent when adding or removing a principal.  See [Mapped bearer tokens](docs/guides/authentication.md#mapped-bearer-tokens-multi-subject) in the authentication guide for the bearer-tokens TOML schema.

In single-token mode (`REQENG_MCP_BEARER_TOKEN`) every authenticated caller shares one subject — the library's default (currently `"bearer-anon"`), override with `REQENG_MCP_BEARER_DEFAULT_SUBJECT`; reference *that* string as the ACL key.  In stdio mode the subject is the literal `"local"`.

### Load semantics

The ACL file is loaded **once at server startup**.  Restart the server to pick up changes; live reload is not part of the initial implementation.  `load_acl` fails fast with `ConfigurationError` on every malformed condition, so a typo in the ACL file aborts startup rather than silently denying requests.

### Privacy default

Denied requests are logged at WARNING with the subject string for audit attribution.  The wire-side error payload **omits** the subject by default to limit cross-user information disclosure.  For internal-only servers where the subject is safe to surface to clients, construct the middleware with `AuthorizationMiddleware(..., expose_subject_in_error=True)`.

## Post-scaffold checklist

After `copier copy` and `gh repo create --push`:

1. **Fill in the DOMAIN blocks** in this README (Features, What you can do with it, Domain configuration, Key design decisions) and in `CLAUDE.md`.
2. Configure GitHub secrets — see below.
3. Install dev + docs tooling: `uv sync --all-extras --all-groups`.
4. Install pre-commit hooks: `uv run pre-commit install`.
5. Run the gate locally: `uv run pytest -x -q && uv run ruff check --fix . && uv run ruff format . && uv run mypy src/ tests/`.
6. Push the first commit — CI should be green.

## GitHub secrets

CI workflows reference three repository secrets. Configure them via **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** or with `gh secret set`:

| Secret | Used by | How to generate |
|---|---|---|
| `RELEASE_TOKEN` | `release.yml`, `copier-update.yml` | Fine-grained PAT at <https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new> with `contents: write` and `pull_requests: write` (the `copier-update` cron opens PRs). Scoped to this repo. |
| `CODECOV_TOKEN` | `ci.yml` | <https://codecov.io> — sign in with GitHub, add the repo, copy the upload token from the repo settings page. |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` | `claude.yml`, `claude-code-review.yml` | Run `claude setup-token` locally and paste the result. |

```bash
gh secret set RELEASE_TOKEN
gh secret set CODECOV_TOKEN
gh secret set CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN
```

`GITHUB_TOKEN` is auto-provided — no action needed.

## Local development

The PR gate (matches CI):

```bash
uv run pytest -x -q                                  # tests
uv run ruff check --fix . && uv run ruff format .    # lint + format
uv run mypy src/ tests/                              # type-check
```

Pre-commit runs a subset of the gate on each commit; see `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for details, or [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for the full Hard PR Acceptance Gates.

## Troubleshooting

### Moving a scaffolded project

`uv sync` creates `.venv/bin/*` scripts with absolute shebangs pointing at the venv Python. If you move the repo after scaffolding (`mv /old/path /new/path`), `uv run pytest` fails with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastmcp'` because the stale shebang resolves to a different interpreter than the venv's site-packages.

**Fix:**

```bash
rm -rf .venv
uv sync --all-extras --all-groups
```

`uv run python -m pytest` also works as a one-shot workaround (bypasses the stale entry-script shim).

### `uv.lock` refresh after `copier update`

When `copier update` introduces new dependencies (e.g. a new extra added to `pyproject.toml.jinja`), CI runs `uv sync --frozen` which fails against a stale lockfile. Run `uv lock` locally and commit the refreshed `uv.lock` alongside accepting the copier-update PR.

<!-- ===== TEMPLATE-OWNED SECTIONS END ===== -->

## Domain configuration

<!-- DOMAIN-START -->
<!-- Replace with a table of domain-specific env vars. Kept across copier update. -->

Domain environment variables use the `REQENG_MCP_` prefix:

| Variable | Default | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `REQENG_MCP_EXAMPLE_VAR` | — | **Yes** | Replace this row with your first required setting. |
| `REQENG_MCP_ANOTHER_VAR` | `default` | No | Replace with an optional setting. |

Domain-config fields are composed inside `src/reqeng_mcp/config.py` between the `CONFIG-FIELDS-START` / `CONFIG-FIELDS-END` sentinels; env reads go through `fastmcp_pvl_core.env(_ENV_PREFIX, "SUFFIX", default)` so naming stays consistent.
<!-- DOMAIN-END -->

## Key design decisions

<!-- DOMAIN-START -->
<!-- Replace with 3-6 bullets describing non-obvious architectural decisions. Kept across copier update. -->

_Replace this placeholder with a short list of the non-obvious design calls this service makes — e.g. "writes are append-only", "embeddings cached in SQLite", "auth uses OIDC bearer tokens". Three to six bullets is typically enough; link out to longer ADRs under `docs/decisions/` if you maintain any._
